# Installation and A Sample Project

Users are suggested to go through the [SmvTraining](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SmvTraining) project first so as to gain a preliminary idea of SMV and have the basic environment set up. Particularly, the below two steps are crucial.

## SMV Installation
Users can [use smv with docker](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV#installation), where the standard environment has been built in the docker container. Alternatively, users can follow [this guide](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV/blob/master/docs/user/smv_install.md) to install smv step by step locally. Please be kindly noted that current examples in this tutorial are based on SMV version [d6ec7f2](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV/tree/d6ec7f252256248f2f13c46fc7afc407ff29a2fd). Users are expected to learn how to use smv for data analytics in general; and for updates in usage and syntax, please refer to [latest project](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV) and latest sample app from `smv-init`.

## Get Started with SMV via A Sample Project
As a starting point, users can firstly work on the [sample project](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV#smv-quickstart) as in the training program. The first section of the tutorial will also be based on the same sample project.
