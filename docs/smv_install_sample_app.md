# Installation and A Sample Project

The first steps are to 1) install SMV and 2) start using SMV with an example app embedded in the SMV package.

## SMV Installation
Users can [use smv with docker](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV#installation), where the standard environment has been built in the docker container. Alternatively, users can follow [this guide](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV/blob/master/docs/user/smv_install.md) to install smv step by step locally. After successfully installing SMV, users are suggested to validate the installation with the following command:
```shell
type smv-pyrun
```

## Get Started with SMV via A Sample Project
As a starting point, users can firstly initialize a [sample project](https://github.com/TresAmigosSD/SMV#create-example-app). 
```
smv-init -s MyApp
```
The first section of the tutorial will also be based on the same sample project.
